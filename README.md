# Mapping_Earthquakes

By accessing access GeoJSON data, Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

 Adding the legend for the color range of the earthquakes. Basil and Sadhana think a legend will provide the information needed for the colors of the earthquakes to make sense to the viewer without having to click on each marker.
